A real-time traffic sensor web. This is a prototype based on the Android platform and using GPS/accelerometers to track real-time traffic conditions and record them in an online database to be viewed by other users.

This app uses GPS data to track a drivers speed and direction and uses these data to inform an online database of traffic conditions. It is basically applying crowd-sourcing concepts to the problem of live, accurate traffic monitoring.

This application was developmed as a summer internship project under the guidance of Professor WenZhan Song at Georgia State University's Sensorweb Research Laboratory. He has since moved to the [University of Georgia](http://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/).

The app is written in Java for Android smartphones. A server was set up with Google's App Engine service to run server-side Java code. __Crowd Traffic__ was published on Google Play until 2013. The code for the Android app is available [here](../../projectfiles/CrowdTraffic_%20v2.zip).
