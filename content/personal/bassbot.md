As my final project for Georgia Tech's 7633, Human-Robot Interaction, I began exploring robotic musicianship by implementing my own take on some research done with Georgia Tech's [Shimon](http://www.gtcmt.gatech.edu/robotic-musicianship-projects#shimon). This involved building my own robotic musician, BassBot, and implementing software focussed primarily on synchronizing the timing of its playback with a human musician. The final report for the project, including some details of the build, is featured below.
